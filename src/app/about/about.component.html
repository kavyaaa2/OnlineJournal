                One of the ways to deal with any overwhelming emotion is to find a healthy way to express yourself. This
                makes a journal a helpful tool in managing your mental health. Journaling can help you:<br>
                <ul>
                    <li>Manage anxiety</li>

                    <li>Reduce stress</li>

                    <li>Cope with depression</li>
                </ul>

                Journaling helps control your symptoms and improve your mood by:
                <ul>
                    <li>Helping you prioritize problems, fears, and concerns</li>


                    <li>Tracking any symptoms day-to-day so that you can recognize triggers and learn ways to better
                        control
                        them</li>
                    <li>Providing an opportunity for positive self-talk and identifying negative thoughts and behaviors
                    </li>
                </ul>
                When you have a problem and you're stressed, keeping a journal can help you identify what’s causing that
                stress or anxiety. Once you’ve identified your stressors, you can work on a plan to resolve the problems
                and
                reduce your stress.

                <br>
                Try these tips to help you get started with journaling:<br><br>

                Try to write every day. Set aside a few minutes every day to write. This will help you to write in your
                journal regularly.<br><br>

                Make it easy. Keep a pen and paper handy at all times. Then when you want to write down your thoughts,
                you
                can. You can also keep a journal on your smartphone.<br><br>

                Write whatever feels right. Your journal doesn't need to follow any certain structure. It's your
                own
                private place to discuss and create whatever you want to express your feelings. Let the words and ideas
                flow
                freely. Don't worry about spelling mistakes or what other people might think.<br><br>

                Use your journal as you see fit. You don't have to share your journal with anyone. If you do want to
                share
                some of your thoughts with trusted friends and loved ones, you could show them parts of your
                journal.<br><br>

                Keeping a journal helps you create order when your world feels like it’s in chaos. You get to know
                yourself
                by revealing your most private fears, thoughts, and feelings. Look at your writing time as personal
                relaxation time. It's a time when you can de-stress and wind down. Write in a place that's relaxing and
                soothing, maybe with a cup of tea. Look forward to your journaling time. And know that you're doing
                something good for your mind and body.<br>
